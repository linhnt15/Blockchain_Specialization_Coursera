### Understand Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchain

___

##### 1. Permissionless Blockchain

\- **Concept:**

+ No need an authorization.

+ Anyone can join and leave. 

+ Is suitable for crypto currency, voting, digital identity,... applications. 

\- **Characteristics:**

+ Trustworthy: we can track and read past transactions. 

+ Transparency: Any nodes can observe transactions.

+ True decentralization

+ Anonymity: joiners stay anonymous.

+ Secure: blocks are immutable thanks to cryptography and security features. 

### 2. Permissioned Blockchain

\- **Concept:**

+ Participants need specific authorization from the network admin or owner. 

+ Is used when you do not want to make your operations, transactions or data public (i.e., Bank, businesses with specific laws,..).

\- **Characteristics:**

+ Need a central supervision that may include validator nodes to verify transactions.

+ Varying degrees of decentralization:  the network may be modified to meet specific needs at different times.

+ Have fast speed and to be more scalable.

+ Anonymity and transparency: only the centralized organization knows anything about participants if they want due to KYC process. Participants' identity is safeguarded by encryption. 

### 3. Benefits and Drawbacks of Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains

|Permissionless Blockchain|Permissioned (Consortium) Blockchain|
|---|---|
|For everyone who wants to join or leave|Participants who have authorization can join|
|Participants are incentivized to join networks|N/A|
|Transaction speed is sluggish because the time is required for validation|Permissioned blockchains are often faster since they select their consensus mechanism and do not need every node for validation. These are much more scalable.|
|energy-intensive requirements for verifying transaction|May adhere a governance framework|
