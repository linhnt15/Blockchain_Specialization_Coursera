#### Blockchain interoperability [1]

___

\- **Blockchain interoperability** means *connecting multiple blockchains* to *mutually* access information and act on it by ***changing the state of each other***. It attempts to enable secure state transitions across diferent blockchains, either homogeneous or heterogeneous.

\- **Types of blockchain interoperability**:

+ `Cross-chain models`:

  + **Cross-chain token transfers**:
 
    + ***Atomic swaps*** can help to process the cross-chain token transferring process, which allows clients to swap their tokens on diferent chains.
 
  + **Cross-chain state transfers**: aims to develop a generic communication scheme that enables smart contracts on one blockchain A to communicate with those on another blockchain B.
 
\- **Solutions on blockchain interoperability**:

+ `Chain-based Interoperability`: mainly targets public blockchains, e.g., using sidechain, notary, and hash-locking

+ `Bridge-based Interoperability`: targets the implementation of a *bridge* as a connection component across blockchains. Most existing chain-based blockchains are *homogeneous blockchain systems*, in which *tokens* are designed of the same type.

+ `DApp-based Interoperability`: targets application built on top blockchain.
