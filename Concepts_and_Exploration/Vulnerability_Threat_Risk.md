### Vulnerability vs threat vs risk [1]

In term of security in blockchain platforms, we will frequently face terms such as **vulnerability**, **threat**, and **risk**. Therefore, I am going to summarize the key difference between them in this part:

|Vulnerability|Threat |Risk |
|---|---|---|
|A vulnerability exposes your organization to threats.|A threat is a malicious or negative event that takes advantage of a vulnerability.|The risk is the probability of loss and damage when the threat does occur.|
|e.g. a flaw in our systems such as infrastructure, software or human falling for phishing|Affects to CIA triad||
