**Abstract**: Cryptographic methods protect for confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity. [1]

|Authenticity/Authentication|Integrity | Confidentiality|
|---|---|---|
|Authenticity is proving ***who you are***. |Integrity is protecting the data from ***unauthorized changes*** or tampering. | Messages will be encrypted or decrypted using ***cryptographic keys***.|

\- **NOTES:**

+ **Digital signatures** carry the digital certificate of the sender, which usually is issued to the sender from a certificate authority (CA). The digital certificate validates the identity of the sender, which essentially is ensuring authenticity. [2]
