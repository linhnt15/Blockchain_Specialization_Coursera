### Understand Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchain

___

##### 1. Permissionless Blockchain

\- **Concept:**

+ No need authentication and authorization processes.

+ Anyone can join and leave. 

+ Is suitable for crypto currency, voting, digital identity,... applications. 

+ Example: public blockchains, e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum,...

\- **Characteristics:**

+ Trustworthy: we can track and read past transactions. 

+ Transparency: Any nodes can observe transactions.

+ True decentralization

+ Anonymity: joiners stay anonymous.

+ Secure: blocks are immutable thanks to cryptography and security features. 

### 2. Permissioned Blockchain

\- **Concept:**

+ Participants need specific authentication and authorization from the blockchain network nodes. 

+ Is used when you do not want to make your operations, transactions or data public (i.e., Bank, businesses with specific laws,..).

+ Examples: private, consortium blockchains, e.g., Hyperledger Fabric,...

\- **Characteristics:**

+ Validator nodes are pre-selected to verify transactions.

+ Varying degrees of decentralization:  the network may be modified to meet specific needs at different times.

+ Have a better performance and to be more scalable in comparison with permissionless ones.

+ Anonymity and transparency: only the centralized organization knows anything about participants if they want due to KYC process. Participants' identity is safeguarded by cryptography. 

### 3. Benefits and Drawbacks of Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains

|Permissionless Blockchain|Permissioned (Consortium) Blockchain|
|---|---|
|For everyone who wants to join or leave|Participants who have passed the authentication process can join|
|Participants are incentivized to join networks|N/A|
|Transaction confirmation latency is sluggish because the time is required for validation in all consensus nodes|Permissioned blockchains are often faster since they select their consensus mechanism and do not need every node for validation. These are much more scalable.|
|Energy-intensive requirements for verifying transaction|May adhere a governance framework|
